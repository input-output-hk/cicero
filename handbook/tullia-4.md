# Creating an Action in the Cicero-WebUI

## A first visit

After all steps from the [installation](./installation.md) a visit to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) should show the following UI:


![Cicero WebUI Intro](./cicero_webui_intro.png "Cicero WebUI Intro")

The first visit should also change the url to: [http://localhost:8000/action/current?active](http://localhost:8000/action/current?active)

## Click on "Create New Action"
After clicking the "Create New Action" button the browser-url should change to:
[http://localhost:8000/action/new](http://localhost:8000/action/new)

And the UI should correspond to:
![Cicero WebUI New Action](./cicero_webui_new_action.png "Cicero WebUI New Action")

### Add required team to repository
Cicero will use specific credentials to clone the repository from Github.
Therefore the following team 'input-output-hk/devops' needs to be added to the repository used in the next section.

### Enter the path to the Actions, which should be created

First the project needs a [flake.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/tullia-example/blob/main/rust/flake.nix) containing **tullia** Actions, see [Repository layout](./tullia-1.md).

**For any url the 'https://' part needs to be omitted.**

The path to the Actions can be a remote path like [github.com/input-output-hk/tullia-example](github.com/input-output-hk/tullia-example)
or a local path like [/home/developer/IOHK/tullia-example](/home/developer/IOHK/tullia-example/).

**Please note:**

The actual [flake.nix](https://github.com/input-output-hk/tullia-example/blob/main/rust/flake.nix) in this example resides in a subdirectory.

Therefore the URL needs to be adapted to respect [go-getter subdirectories](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#subdirectories):
```
github.com/input-output-hk/tullia-example//rust
```
It's also possible to refer to a specific commit by using:
```
github.com/input-output-hk/tullia-example//rust?ref=yourCommitHash
```

### Assume a valid path or url was entered

It would look like this:

![Cicero WebUI New Tullia](./cicero_webui_new_action_tullia.png "Cicero WebUI New Tullia")

### Click on "List Actions"

Clicking "List Actions" will start the cicero-evaluator, so the Actions are syntactically evaluated and listed:

![Cicero WebUI List Tullia](./cicero_webui_list_actions_tullia.png "Cicero WebUI List Tullia")

If an error occurs while evaluating, Cicero will print the error in it's logs but also will show an error in the WebUI.

### Click on the "rust/build" Action

Clicking on "rust/build" will create the corresponding Action in Cicero:

![Cicero WebUI Create Tullia](./cicero_webui_create_action_tullia.png "Cicero WebUI Create Tullia")

Please note that this Action hasn't run yet, which is also indicated by the "Runs" table at the bottom.

How to run the actual Action is explained in the [following chapter](./tullia-5.md).
